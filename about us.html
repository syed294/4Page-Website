    <h1>People of Karachi</h1>

    <p>The city, which once comprised primarily Sindhis and the Baloch, is now made up of several ethnic groups. The most numerous are Urdu-speaking muhājirs, Muslims who left India as a result of the 1947 partition. Punjabis and Pashtuns have sizable communities in Karachi as well. There are also communities of Black African ancestry, called “Makranis” and “Sheedis,” whose ancestors were taken from Africa to Karachi in the Indian slave trade.</p>

    <p>The population is almost entirely Muslim, but there are small Christian, Hindu, Parsi, Buddhist, and Jain minorities. Some of the members of the Christian minority are of Indo-Pakistani origin, while others are descended from Portuguese or other European groups.</p>

    <h1>Economy</h1>
    <h1>Industry</h1>
    <p>Textiles and footwear are the principal items manufactured, followed by such items as metal products, food and beverages, paper and printing, wood and furniture, machinery, chemicals and petroleum, leather and rubber, and electrical goods. Karachi is also an important centre for handicrafts and cottage industries that produce handloomed cloth, lace, carpets, articles made of brass and bell metal (an alloy of copper and tin), pottery, leather goods, and gold and silver embroidery. Karachi handles the entire seaborne trade of Pakistan and of landlocked Afghanistan.</p>

    <h1>Finance</h1>
    <p>There are more than 25 banks in Karachi that have branches throughout Pakistan; these include the State Bank of Pakistan, the Habib Bank Ltd., the National Bank of Pakistan, the United Bank Ltd., the Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan, and the Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan. The city is also the centre of about two dozen insurance companies, which play an important role in the economic development of the country by investing large sums in power development, housing programs, joint-stock companies, government loan securities, and savings certificates.</p>

    <p>Karachi has a stock exchange that handles nearly all of the transactions in government securities and in the shares of most of the important industrial and financial institutions.</p>

    <h1>Transportation</h1>

    <p>The Karachi-Peshāwar highway links the city with the interior of Pakistan, while the Karachi-Ormāra highway extends along the coast. The Karachi-to-Zāhedān highway connects it with Iran and other Middle Eastern countries. Express roads radiate from the city centre, while feeder roads connect the express roads with local streets.</p>
    <p>Karachi is the terminus of Pakistan’s railway system, which mainly serves to transport goods between Karachi and the interior. There are also passenger trains, as well as a circular railway that skirts the city on the north and the east, for commuter traffic and the transport of goods between the port and the industrial areas.</p>
    <p>Jinnah International Airport provides international service. The port of Karachi is one of the busiest east of Suez.</p>
